<p1>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of increasing the quality and quantity of website traffic, increasing visibility of a website or a web page to users of a web search engine. SEO refers to the improvement of unpaid results (known as "natural" or "organic" results), and excludes the purchase of paid placement.
SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, video search, academic search, news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines.</p1>
